ESP32 Learning Journey

Welcome to my ESP32 learning repository! 🚀
This repository is dedicated to my journey in learning about ESP32 from scratch. Here, I will document my progress, share code snippets, and explore various aspects of this powerful microcontroller.

📌 What is ESP32?
ESP32 is a low-cost, low-power system-on-chip microcontroller with integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities. It is widely used for IoT applications, home automation, and embedded systems.

🎯 Goals of This Repository
- Learn the basics of ESP32 hardware and software
- Explore different programming environments (VSC, PlatformIO, ESP-IDF)
- Experiment with various sensors, modules, and communication protocols
- Build small projects to reinforce learning
- Document findings, issues, and solutions
